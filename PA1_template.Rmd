## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r readdata, echo=TRUE}
# Remove all variables on the present workscreen
rm(list=ls())
# setting the working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Yoocuph/Desktop/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
# Unzip to to this directory
    unzip("activity.zip")
# opening connection to the data 
activitycon <- file("C:/Users/Yoocuph/Desktop/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity.csv",open="r")
# reading the data into the console
activity <- read.csv(activitycon, header = T)
# Closing the Opened COnnection
close(activitycon)
# Converting the date into a POIXct format
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME","English_United States.1252")
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(as.Date(activity$date,format="%Y-%m-%d"))
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Plotting the total number of steps taken per day.
```{r histogram1, echo=TRUE}
# Obtaining the total number of steps taken per day
steps_sum <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
# Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day 
# using the ggplot2 system
library(ggplot2)
plot1 <- qplot(x = steps_sum, geom = "histogram", binwidth = 2000)
plot2 <- plot1 + labs(title = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps taken per Day")
plot3 <- plot2 + labs(x = "Total Number of Steps", y = "Count")
# print the plot
print(plot3)
```

Reporting the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r meanmedian1, echo=TRUE}
# Computing the mean total steps taken per day 
steps_mean <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
# Computing the median total steps taken per day 
steps_median <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, median, na.rm = TRUE)
steps_mean
steps_median
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Computing the average number of steps taken every 5 minutes interval over all days considered
```{r intervalplot, echo=TRUE}
# computing average number of steps taken every 5 minutes
stepsinterval_mean <- as.numeric(tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
# creatin the x axis variable (5 minutes interval)
activity$interval <- factor(activity$interval)
steps_interval <- as.numeric(levels(activity$interval))
average_interval <- data.frame(steps_interval, stepsinterval_mean)
# Making the time series plot using ggplot2 
plot4 <- ggplot(data = average_interval, aes(x=as.numeric(steps_interval), y = stepsinterval_mean))
plot4 <- plot4 + geom_line(colour = "steelblue")
plot4 <- plot4 + labs(title = "Time Plot of Total Number of Steps taken every 5 Mins.", x = "5 Minutes Interval", y = "Average Number of Steps Taken")
print(plot4)
```
  
Finding the 5 minutes interval with the maximum average number of steps.
```{r intervalmaximum, echo=TRUE}
interval_mean <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
max_mean <- max(interval_mean)
max_find <- max_mean == interval_mean
max_interval <- interval_mean[max_find==TRUE]
names(max_interval)
```


## Imputing missing values

Counting the number of missing values in the data set.
```{r missingdata,echo=TRUE}
activity$test1 <- complete.cases(activity)
test2 <- table(activity$test1)
test2[c("FALSE")]
```
  
Obtaining a new dataset by filling in the missing values with the mean of the 5 mins interval across the days
```{r newdata,echo=TRUE}
#A loop to check for where missing values and fill them with the mean of the 5 
#mins interval across the days
for(i in 1:length(activity$test))
  {
    if(activity$test[i] == FALSE)
      {
        a <- activity$interval[i]
        dat1 <- activity[(activity$interval == a),]
        activity$steps[i] <- mean(dat1$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
      }
  }
```  
  
Plotting the Histogram of the filled Data Set
```{r newhistogram,echo=TRUE}
steps_sum2 <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum ,na.rm = TRUE)
# Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day 
plot11 <- qplot(x = steps_sum2, geom = "histogram", binwidth = 2000)
plot12 <- plot11 + labs(title = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps taken per Day")
plot13 <- plot12 + labs(x = "Total Number of Steps", y = "Count")
# print the plot
print(plot13)
```
  
Reporting the mean and median total number of steps taken per day for the new dataset
```{r newmeanmedian, echo=TRUE}
# Computing the mean total steps taken per day 
steps_mean2 <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
# Computing the median total steps taken per day 
steps_median2 <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, median, na.rm = TRUE)
steps_mean2
steps_median2
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Creating the factor variable day with two levels "weekday" and "weekend"
```{r weekdayweekend,echo=TRUE}
# Obtaining the days of the week the steps were taken
activity$days <- weekdays(activity$date, abbreviate = TRUE)
# A loop to group each dat to its appropriate week group i.e. weekend or weekdays
for(i in 1:length(activity$days))
  {
    if(activity$days[i] == "Sat" || activity$days[i] == "Sun")
      {
        activity$group[i] <- 2
      }
    else
      {
        activity$group[i] <- 1
      }  
  }
activity$group <- factor(activity$group, levels=c(1,2), labels = c("weekdays","weekend"))
```
Making a Panel time Plot of of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken.
```{r plotgroup, echo=TRUE}
# Dividing the data according the the day group i.e. weekday or weekend
steps_weekend <- activity[(activity$group == "weekend"),]
#
steps_weekday <- activity[(activity$group == "weekday"),]
#
averagesteps_weekend <- as.numeric(tapply(steps_weekend$steps, steps_weekend$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
#
averagesteps_weekday <- as.numeric(tapply(steps_weekday$steps, steps_weekday$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
# Computing the required averages and obtaining the plot data frame. 
average_steps <- as.numeric(cbind(averagesteps_weekday, averagesteps_weekend))
group <- gl(2,288,labels = c("weekday","weekend"))
tsteps <- as.numeric(cbind(steps_interval, steps_interval))
plot_frame <- data.frame(tsteps, average_steps, group)
# Plotting the Data using the ggplot2 system
plot21 <- ggplot(plot_frame, aes(x = tsteps, y = average_steps))
plot21 <- plot21 +geom_line(colour = "steelblue")
plot21 <- plot21 + labs(title="Time Plot of Average Number of Steps Taken", x = "5-Minutes Interval", y = "Average Steps Taken")
plot21 <- plot21 + facet_grid(group~.)
print(plot21)
#Remove all variables from screen
rm(list=ls())
```
